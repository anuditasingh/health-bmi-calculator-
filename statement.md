problem statement 
 
 The core problem statement for health calculators is to provide individuals and healthcare professionals with accessible, data-driven tools for estimating, tracking, and managing various health metrics and risks, thereby supporting informed decision-making and promoting preventative care. 
Key problem areas that health calculators address include:
Complexity of Health Metrics: Many important health indicators (e.g., Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Body Mass Index (BMI), A1C levels, cardiovascular risk scores) rely on complex formulas or multiple data points that are difficult for individuals to calculate manually.
Need for Personalized Assessment: General health advice often fails to account for individual factors like age, sex, weight, lifestyle habits, and existing conditions. Calculators help bridge this gap by providing personalized estimates based on user-specific inputs.
Identifying Gaps and Priorities for Intervention: Calculators can help identify individuals or groups at higher risk for certain conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, specific cancers) by processing available data and comparing it to established clinical guidelines. This allows for targeted, preventative interventions.
Accessibility of Clinical Scores: Traditional clinical scoring systems are primarily used by medical professionals within a clinical setting. Online and app-based calculators make these tools more widely available to the general public, empowering individuals to monitor their own health.
Data Integration and Efficiency: A major problem in clinical practice is the time-consuming process of manually collecting and entering data for risk stratification scores. Automating these calculations within electronic health records (EHRs) or standalone apps improves efficiency and reduces human error.
Planning Future Healthcare Needs: Financial health calculators help individuals estimate potential future healthcare costs based on current health status, family size, and financial capacity, enabling better planning for health insurance and savings. 

 scope of the project 
 The scope of a project health calculator encompasses defining, measuring, and reporting the overall condition and performance of a project across key metrics like scope, schedule, budget, resources, and quality. 
The scope includes the following primary components:
Key Metrics for Calculation
The project health calculator typically uses various indicators and data points to determine overall status. These often include: 
Schedule Performance: Tracking progress against the planned timeline, using metrics like Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Critical Path Length Index (CPLI).
Cost Performance: Monitoring expenditure relative to the planned budget, utilizing metrics such as Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Earned Value (EV) analysis.
Scope Management: Assessing scope creep and ensuring all changes are documented and approved. Jira's sprint health gadgets, for example, calculate scope change percentage based on added or removed story points.
Resource Utilization: Evaluating how effectively resources (people, equipment, etc.) are being used.
Quality and Risk: Identifying potential issues, outstanding action items, and ensuring deliverables meet quality standard..
 
 Target users
The target users for health calculators are individuals of all ages seeking to monitor their health, including those focused on weight management, fitness, and general health awareness. Specific users include people aiming for a specific body mass index (BMI), athletes calculating target heart rates, and individuals managing chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. Healthcare professionals also use these tools to provide personalized guidance.
