Title of the project-
Health Calculator 
Overview of the project.

BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a simple and widely used method to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight in relation to their height. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.

BMI helps categorize individuals into different groups such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obese. These categories indicate the level of body fat and can help identify health risks associated with being under or overweight.

BMI is commonly used in healthcare, fitness centers, and research because it is quick, non-invasive, and requires only basic measurements. Although it does not directly measure body fat, it gives a useful estimation to monitor weight status and guide health decisions.
Features of the Project --
The primary goal of the BMI Calculator is to promote health awareness by offering an accessible way for individuals to understand a key metric of their body composition.
​Key Uses:

​Health Screening: It serves as an initial screening tool to identify potential weight-related health risks, signaling when a person might need to consult a healthcare professional.

​Tracking Progress: Individuals can use it to track changes in their body composition over time, especially when on a diet or exercise program.  

​Educational Tool: It helps users understand the relationship between their height and weight, and what the internationally recognized BMI categories mean.

​Simplicity and Accessibility: It offers a calculation that is easy to perform, requiring only two inputs (weight and height), making it highly accessible to the general public.

Technology used-
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language renowned for its readability and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, its design philosophy emphasizes clear and concise code, often employing significant indentation to define code block.

Libraries used for making this project as follows--
1) matplotlib.pypplot
2) os
3) csv
4) sys

matplotlib.pyplot as plt is used to plot the graph of the bmi.

 steps to install and run the project..
 firstly  install the libraries like matplotlib, os, csv.
 to install just command pip install the desired library.

 Instructions-
