The logic for a BMI calculator involves dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters, 
To use it, first, ensure weight is in kilograms and height is in meters (if your height is in cm , divide by 100 to convert). The logic for a BMI calculator involves dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters, according to the formula: BMI = weight (\(kg\)) / (height (\(m\))\({2}\)). To use it, first, ensure weight is in kilograms and height is in meters (if your height is in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert). Next, square the height (height \(m\) $ \times $ height \(m\)) and then divide the weight by that result to get the BMI. 
Step-by-step logic    
Get user input: Obtain the user's weight and height.  Convert units: If the weight is not in kilograms, convert it to kilograms.  If the height is not in meters, convert it: divide centimeters by 100.  Calculate height squared:
Multiply the height in meters by itself. For example, a height of \(1.75\) meters becomes \(1.75\times 1.75=3.0625\).  Calculate BMI: Divide the weight in kilograms by the result from the previous step.  Display result:
Present the calculated BMI to the user. For example, a BMI of \(22.5\).
